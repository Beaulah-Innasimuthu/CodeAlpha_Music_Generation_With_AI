# Music Generation with AI

This repository contains a project focused on generating music using artificial intelligence (AI) with TensorFlow/Keras. The notebook utilizes a neural network to generate music based on a training dataset and various deep learning techniques.

## Project Structure

- **`music_generation_with_ai.ipynb`**: The core Jupyter notebook that implements music generation using a deep learning model.
- **`training_checkpoints/`**: Directory where model checkpoints will be saved during training.

## Features

- **Deep Learning Model**: A neural network architecture trained to generate sequences of music.
- **Callbacks**:
  - Model checkpointing to save the model's best weights based on validation loss.
  - Early stopping to prevent overfitting and ensure optimal performance.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/music-generation-ai.git
   cd music-generation-ai
   ```

2. **Install the required packages**:
   Ensure you have Python 3.x installed and set up. Install dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   The main dependencies include:
   - `tensorflow`
   - `numpy`
   - `fluidsynth` (for audio synthesis, if used)

3. **Download the required datasets** (if applicable):
   The notebook may require datasets for training, which should be specified and downloaded.

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook music_generation_with_ai.ipynb
   ```

2. Train the model using your own dataset or an existing dataset. Modify the data loading section in the notebook accordingly.

3. The model will automatically save the best weights to the `training_checkpoints` folder. You can adjust the model's parameters in the notebook as per your needs.

## Model Checkpointing

The model uses the `ModelCheckpoint` callback to save the best-performing model weights based on validation loss. This ensures that only the optimal model is saved.

### Example Callback Setup:

```python
callbacks = [
    tf.keras.callbacks.ModelCheckpoint(
        filepath='./training_checkpoints/ckpt_{epoch:02d}.weights.h5',
        save_weights_only=True,
        monitor='val_loss',
        save_best_only=True,
        verbose=1
    ),
    tf.keras.callbacks.EarlyStopping(
        monitor='val_loss',
        patience=5,
        verbose=1,
        restore_best_weights=True
    )
]
```

## Results

After training, you can load the best model weights and use the model to generate new sequences of music.
